# AndroidDev_Abertay2018-S2
Files and projects for the "Software Development for Mobile Devices" module at 
Abertay University, Semester 2 of academic year 2017/2018

Present files are only core code, layout- and behaviour-related files necessary for any of the apps to work.
If these are added to a new Android Studio project and compiled, they should recreate the app without any issues.
All other build-related extra files and directories are for this reason not included in this repository.

Content is divided by weeks, and for each week it is further separated based on the various tutorials of that
particular week, OR complete, separated apps. These, even if part of the same tutorial, their content and/or
functionality is too different and confined to a specific section for them to be in the same build.

Lecturer: Andrei Boiko (PhD) - credits for a lot of the code to him as part of his tutorials
